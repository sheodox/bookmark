Well Read is a website for tracking your reading of long book series.

I made this to track how many pages I read in a session and to better organize notes about where the story left off when I finish a volume. Once caught up on a long running series it might be 6+ months of waiting for a new volume to release, so I want to keep some notes to not be completely lost when I dive back into a new book.
